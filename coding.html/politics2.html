2019 polls: Mamata Banerjee trying to hold off BJP by reclaiming Lord Ram, but only dividing her base and state

West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s moves to contest BJP’s monopoly over Lord Ram appear to have backfired. Visits to recently riot-hit areas, both industrial and rural, indicate that Mamata’s latest maneuvers have divided her Muslim and Hindu support base, alienated some of them and communalised the factional feuds in her party, Trinamool Congress (TMC) at the ground level.</p>

<p>Unlike BJP, which is openly playing its Hindu hyper-nationalist card and leaving no stone unturned to whip up anti-Muslim sentiments among Hindus in Bengal and elsewhere, secular nationalists à la Rahul Gandhi, Akhilesh Yadav and Mamata constantly need to balance between the majority and minority community perceptions about them. In his effort to outsmart the Sangh Parivar at its own game, Rahul has resorted to soft Hindutva tactics from Gujarat to Karnataka largely by visiting temples while ignoring Muslims in his public discourse against BJP.</p>

<p>But Mamata cannot afford such high profile temple-hopping after having aggressively wooed the conservatives in the minority community that comprise more than 27 percent of the state population and which have been providing her solid electoral support since 2011. On the other hand, she can’t ignore the growing impact of BJP among Hindus, particularly in industrial-urban and bordering areas, which are more vulnerable to anti-Muslim hate campaigns. So, she asked TMC men to hijack Ram Navami and Hanuman Jayanti processions from BJP-VHP and play greater Ram bhakts with the hope  of poaching the saffron support base or winning the fence-sitters, particularly among Hindi-speaking people before next year's Lok Sabha polls.</p>

<p>But tightrope walking needs practiced skill, controlled body and mind, as well as firm props. Else, the player is bound to fall and sustain injuries which can be fatal. Evidently, Bengal’s prima donna of street politics has suffered not only due to absence of a disciplined organisation such as the RSS or CPM, but also because of her misjudgment of ground reality.</p>
