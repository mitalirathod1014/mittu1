At 32, Deepika Padukone is among TIME's 100 influential people in the world. Quite a feat to achieve at her age. But then that's Deepika for you. A fabulous actress, a stellar performer, a superstar and a diva.</p>
<br/>
<p>11 years after this Bengaluru girl made her big-screen debut, Deepika has finally arrived and how. What makes her new achievement all the more memorable is the fact that she is the only Bollywood celebrity to make it to the list this year. At a time when almost every Bollywood star is opting for unique work and trying to make a difference to the society in their own little way, it is Deepika who has made it so far that she, today, is 'influencing' the world.</p>
<br/>
<p>Indeed, a well-deserved mention.</p>
<br/>
<p>RISE OF THE PHOENIX</p>
<br/>
<p>Back in 2007 when Deepika began her Bollywood journey with Farah Khan's Om Shaanti Om, little did anyone know that this girl from Bengaluru's illustrious Padukone family would become a name to reckon with in Bollywood. When many made the mistake of writing her off as a one-film wonder after her debut film, Deepika worked hard with each film to make herself relevant in an industry that's ruthless to underperformers.</p>
<br/>
<p>But in the monsoon of 2012, Deepika made her critics and fans sit up and take notice of her. It was Homi Adajania's Cocktail that made this phoenix rise from her ashes, and the country only gaped in awe.</p>
