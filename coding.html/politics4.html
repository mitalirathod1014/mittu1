<p>An ordinance to pronounce death penalty to those convicted of raping a child up to 12 years of age was approved by the Union Cabinet on Saturday and promulgated by President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday.</p>

<p>The Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance 2018, which provides stringent punishment to those convicted of rape in a bid to protect children from sexual violence, saw mixed reactions from Congress as well leaders from other Opposition parties. While some of them welcomed the ordinance, a few had their reservations.

<p>Senior advocate and Congress leader Salman Khurshid was one of the only Opposition leaders to show his trepidation about the ordinance, saying that the ruling government must rather focus on the root cause of these crimes.</p>

<p>"This is a sensitive issue and incidents that have taken place recently are shameful. The government should contemplate its decision. We need to address the root cause of such crimes, as there's a limit to which the judiciary can help," Khurshid said to ANI.</p>
On the other hand, Congress spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi said that while the party welcomes any severe measure to ensure that the accused in such crimes are brought to book, she questioned why it took so long for the law to be promulgated.</p>

<p>"What makes me question the intent of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Narendra Modi government is that why did it take them so much time to reach to this conclusion that a stricter law and stricter punishment would bring in the desired change," she said to PTI.</p>

<p>Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh did not hesitate to hail the decision, calling the ordinance a "revolutionary and necessary" step.</p>

<p>"Such criminals are a blot on the face of humanity and deserve no mercy," he said, adding that he was all for exemplary punishment in cases of rape of minors. "The measure would act as a deterrent to the heinous crime, which had shaken the nation to the core in recent months," the chief minister said in a statement.</p>
