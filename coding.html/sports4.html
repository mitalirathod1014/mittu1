Jhulan Goswami gets commemorative stamp of honour for claiming 200 ODI wickets</p>

<p>New Delhi: More than two months after registering a record-breaking feat in women's cricket, ace Indian cricketer Jhulan Goswami was commemorated for her efforts. In the second ODI match South Africa back in February, Jhulan had dismissed batswoman Laura Wolvaardt to claim her 200th wicket in the fifty-over format, thus becoming the first women's cricketer ever to achieve the mark. Ergo, on Friday 20 April at the Calcutta Sports Journalists' Club, she was honoured with a postage stamp featuring her photo on it. </p>

<p>It couldn't have been a better way to honour Jhulan and her stellar 16-year long career donning the Indian blue. Former Indian cricketer Sourav Ganguly was there on Friday to unveil the stamp. In fact, former Australian woman cricketer Lisa Sthalekar took to Twitter to share a picture of the stamp and also write, "How good is this!!! To commemorate the fact that Jhulan Goswami became the 1st player to reach 200 ODI wickets. #womenscricket."</p>
