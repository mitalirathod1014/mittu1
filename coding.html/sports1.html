<p>Ishant Sharma, the tall and lanky Indian fast bowler is having a field day at his county stint for England's Division Two County club Sussex. After his blistering spell with the ball, the 29-year-old speedster has scribed his name in history books with his maiden first-class fifty for Sussex. The pacer was in the thick of things after not getting picked up in the eleventh edition of the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL). The fate now seems was a blessing in disguise as the Delhi bowler is hogging the headlines for all the right reasons and that too san IPL.</p>

<p>After a phenomenal start with the ball in his county debut against Warwickshire, Ishant steamed things up with a sturdy batting display against Leicestershire in the ongoing game. Coming out to bat at the tail with 240 runs on board at the loss of seven wickets, Ishant's maiden first-class fifty guided Sussex to 438/8. The 29-year-old played for 182 minutes and faced 141 deliveries to tally 66 runs with the help of six boundaries and one over-boundary.</p>
